"""
Action boundaries from the screen recording alone: pHash tile activity finds the
frames where the screen stands still, and a VLM judges each settled state against
an ANCHOR holding the last established one.

Reads only the video stream, so the modality stays independent for the ablation.

The module is layered so the decisions are separable from the decoding: the
activity signal is a function of a frame SEQUENCE, the dwell segmentation a
function of that signal, and the anchor walk a function of the dwells plus two
callables. Only `_scan`, `_read_frames` and `_frame_times_s` touch OpenCV and
ffprobe.
